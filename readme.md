# Notes 




## Abstract 
This repo contains all LaTeX source codes of the lectures notes I took in University. 


The header.tex can be found in LaTeX Template, together with a simple, but complete demo.


You need to include this header to compile any of my notes! The particular compile environment should not be that relevant since the packages this environment depends on are quite straightforward and minimal, hence a simple pdflatex should do the job.
